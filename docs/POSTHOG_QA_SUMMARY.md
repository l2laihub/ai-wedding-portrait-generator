- Privacy and security compliance
- Lead quality and scoring
- Customer journey tracking
- High-volume performance testing

## Key Testing Areas Defined

### 1. Analytics Events to Track
When PostHog is implemented, these events should be tracked:

**Core Application Events:**
- `app_loaded` - Initial application load
- `image_uploaded` - User uploads couple photo
- `generation_started` - AI generation begins
- `generation_completed` - AI generation successful
- `generation_failed` - AI generation error
- `image_downloaded` - User downloads result
- `style_preference` - User shows style preference

**Lead Capture Events:**
- `lead_form_shown` - Lead form displayed
- `lead_form_filled` - User fills email
- `lead_captured` - Successful lead capture
- `lead_form_dismissed` - User closes form

**Error Events:**
- `gemini_api_error` - AI service errors
- `upload_error` - Image upload failures
- `network_error` - Connectivity issues

### 2. Privacy Protection Requirements

**Prohibited Data (NEVER collect):**
- Email addresses in full
- Personal names
- Image data or metadata
- Location information
- Any personally identifiable information

**Allowed Anonymous Data:**
- Anonymous user IDs (UUIDs)
- Device type and browser info
- Usage patterns and flows
- Performance metrics
- Error categories
- Email domains (for analytics, not identification)

### 3. Performance Thresholds

**Core Web Vitals Targets:**
- First Contentful Paint: < 1.8s
- Largest Contentful Paint: < 2.5s  
- First Input Delay: < 100ms
- Cumulative Layout Shift: < 0.1

**PostHog Impact Limits:**
- Bundle size increase: < 50KB
- Load time impact: < 5%
- Memory usage increase: < 5MB
- Event capture time: < 10ms

### 4. Error Handling Requirements

**Network Resilience:**
- Queue events during offline periods
- Implement exponential backoff for retries
- Handle rate limiting gracefully
- Degrade gracefully during service outages

**Data Validation:**
- Sanitize all event properties
- Handle circular references
- Truncate oversized payloads
- Filter out functions and invalid data

## Next Steps for Implementation Team

### 1. Before Integration
- [ ] Review all testing documentation
- [ ] Set up PostHog project and obtain API key
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Plan event taxonomy based on defined events

### 2. During Integration
- [ ] Install PostHog package: `npm install posthog-js`
- [ ] Follow privacy compliance checklist
- [ ] Implement PII protection measures
- [ ] Add event tracking for defined events
- [ ] Configure proper user identification

### 3. Testing Phase
- [ ] Execute comprehensive testing checklist
- [ ] Run performance impact assessment
- [ ] Validate privacy compliance
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios
- [ ] Verify lead capture functionality
- [ ] Document results using provided template

### 4. Pre-Launch
- [ ] Complete browser compatibility testing
- [ ] Perform final privacy audit
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Train team on analytics interpretation
- [ ] Prepare for ongoing monitoring

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
1. **PII Leakage** - Critical to prevent any personal information in analytics
2. **Performance Impact** - Must not significantly slow down the application
3. **GDPR Compliance** - Essential for European users
4. **Error Handling** - Analytics failures should not break app functionality

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Automated PII Detection** - Implement regex patterns to catch PII
2. **Performance Budgets** - Set strict limits on bundle size and load time
3. **Privacy by Design** - Build privacy protection into every event
4. **Graceful Degradation** - Analytics failures should be invisible to users

## Success Criteria

The PostHog integration will be considered successful when:

- [ ] All defined events are tracking accurately
- [ ] No PII is being transmitted to PostHog
- [ ] Performance impact is under 5% across all metrics
- [ ] Error handling works robustly in all scenarios
- [ ] Lead capture functionality is validated
- [ ] Privacy compliance is verified
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility is confirmed
- [ ] Team can interpret and act on analytics data
