# PostHog Analytics Testing Checklist

## Pre-Testing Requirements
- [ ] Verify PostHog is installed as dependency in package.json
- [ ] Confirm PostHog API key is configured in environment variables
- [ ] Check PostHog initialization in main app entry point
- [ ] Verify PostHog project settings match requirements

## 1. Analytics Events Testing

### Core Events
- [ ] **Page View Events**
  - [ ] Initial app load tracking
  - [ ] Route changes (if applicable)
  - [ ] Verify page view properties (URL, referrer, etc.)

- [ ] **User Interaction Events**
  - [ ] Image upload initiated
  - [ ] Image upload completed
  - [ ] Generate button clicked
  - [ ] Style selected (when implemented)
  - [ ] Custom prompt entered
  - [ ] Generated image downloaded
  - [ ] Share button clicked (if implemented)

- [ ] **Generation Flow Events**
  - [ ] Generation started
  - [ ] Generation completed successfully
  - [ ] Generation failed with error
  - [ ] Partial generation success (some styles failed)
  - [ ] Sequential vs concurrent generation mode

### Event Properties Validation
- [ ] User ID/distinct ID properly set
- [ ] Timestamp accuracy
- [ ] Event properties complete and accurate
- [ ] No duplicate events fired
- [ ] Events fired in correct sequence

## 2. Data Transmission Testing

### Network Verification
- [ ] Events sent to correct PostHog endpoint
- [ ] HTTPS used for all transmissions
- [ ] Proper headers included
- [ ] Batch processing working correctly
- [ ] Offline queue functionality

### Data Integrity
- [ ] Events arrive in PostHog dashboard
- [ ] Data matches what was sent
- [ ] No data loss during transmission
- [ ] Proper encoding of special characters

## 3. Performance Impact Testing

### Page Load Performance
- [ ] Measure initial load time without PostHog
- [ ] Measure initial load time with PostHog
- [ ] Document performance delta
- [ ] Verify async loading doesn't block UI

### Runtime Performance
- [ ] Check memory usage with analytics
- [ ] Monitor CPU usage during event tracking
- [ ] Verify no UI freezing during batch sends
- [ ] Test performance on mobile devices
- [ ] Test on slow network connections

### Bundle Size Impact
- [ ] Document PostHog library size
- [ ] Check tree-shaking effectiveness
- [ ] Verify lazy loading if implemented

## 4. Privacy & PII Protection

### Data Collection Compliance
- [ ] No email addresses in events
- [ ] No names or personal identifiers
- [ ] No sensitive image data transmitted
- [ ] IP anonymization enabled (if required)
- [ ] Cookie consent implementation (if required)

### User Privacy Controls
- [ ] Opt-out mechanism functional
- [ ] Do Not Track header respected
- [ ] Data retention policies configured
- [ ] User deletion requests handled

## 5. Error Tracking

### Error Scenarios
- [ ] Network failures handled gracefully
- [ ] PostHog service unavailable
- [ ] Invalid API key handling
- [ ] Event validation failures
- [ ] Rate limiting responses

### Error Recovery
- [ ] Failed events queued for retry
- [ ] Exponential backoff implemented
- [ ] Maximum retry limits enforced
- [ ] Error logging without PII

## 6. Lead Capture Testing

### Form Validation
- [ ] Email validation working
- [ ] Required fields enforced
- [ ] Form submission tracking
- [ ] Success/failure states tracked

### Data Flow
- [ ] Lead data sent to PostHog
- [ ] Proper user identification
- [ ] Lead properties captured correctly
- [ ] Integration with user profiles

## 7. Edge Cases & Stress Testing

### Browser Compatibility
- [ ] Chrome/Edge
- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Safari
- [ ] Mobile browsers
- [ ] PWA mode

### Stress Scenarios
- [ ] Rapid event generation
- [ ] Large batch processing
- [ ] Multiple concurrent users
- [ ] Extended session duration
- [ ] Tab switching/backgrounding

## 8. Feature Flags (if implemented)
- [ ] Flag evaluation tracking
- [ ] A/B test exposure events
- [ ] Feature usage correlation
- [ ] Performance of flag checks

## 9. Session Recording (if enabled)
- [ ] Recording quality acceptable
- [ ] Sensitive data masked
- [ ] Performance impact minimal
- [ ] Storage limits respected

## 10. Integration Testing

### Third-party Integrations
- [ ] GTM compatibility (if used)
- [ ] Other analytics tools coexistence
- [ ] CDN/proxy compatibility
- [ ] Ad blocker detection

### Development Workflow
- [ ] Local development setup
- [ ] Staging environment testing
- [ ] Production deployment verification
- [ ] Debug mode functionality
