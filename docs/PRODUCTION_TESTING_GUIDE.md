# Production Testing Guide
## AI Wedding Portrait Generator - Comprehensive Testing Procedures

This guide provides step-by-step testing procedures to verify all functionality works correctly in production.

## ðŸ§ª Pre-Production Testing

### Environment Validation

**Test Stripe Configuration**
```bash
# 1. Test webhook endpoint health
curl -X POST https://your-domain.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": "health_check"}'

# Expected: 400 status (missing signature) but endpoint responds

# 2. Verify edge function secrets
npx supabase secrets list

# Expected: STRIPE_SECRET_KEY and STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET are set
```

**Test Database Functions**
```bash
# Run credit calculation test
node scripts/test-credit-calculation.js

# Run payment flow test  
node scripts/test-payment-flow.js

# Expected: All tests pass without errors
```

echo "Testing image generation..."
node scripts/test-image-generation.js || exit 1

echo "âœ… All tests passed!"
```

// scripts/verify-credits.js
const { supabase } = require('./supabase-client');

async function verifyCredits() {
  try {
    // Test credit calculation
    const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('get_user_credits_with_reset', {
      p_user_id: 'test-user-id'
    });
    
    if (error) throw error;
    
    console.log('Credit calculation working:', data);
    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Credit verification failed:', error);
    return false;
  }
