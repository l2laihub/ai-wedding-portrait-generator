# Stripe Checkout Integration - Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Removed Demo Mode**
- Updated `UpgradePrompt.tsx` to remove the localhost demo mode
- Now all purchase buttons redirect to real Stripe checkout

### 2. **Backend Server Setup** (`server/dev-server.js`)
- Express server running on port 3001
- `/api/checkout/create` endpoint that:
  - Validates user and creates/retrieves Stripe customer
  - Creates Stripe checkout session with proper metadata
  - Returns checkout URL for redirect

### 3. **Webhook Handler** (`server/dev-server.js`)
- `/api/webhooks/stripe` endpoint that:
  - Verifies Stripe webhook signatures
  - Processes `checkout.session.completed` events
  - Adds credits to user account via Supabase function
  - Handles multiple event types for comprehensive tracking

### 4. **Success Page Flow**
- Created `SuccessPage.tsx` component
- Updated `Router.tsx` to handle success route
- Supports query parameter-based routing (`?success=true&session_id=...`)

### 5. **Environment Configuration**
All necessary Stripe keys are already configured in `.env.local`:
- `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - For frontend
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - For backend
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - For webhook verification
- Price IDs for all three packages

### 6. **Database Integration**
Uses existing Supabase functions:
- `add_paid_credits` - Atomically adds credits after payment
- Credit transaction logging for audit trail

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Start Both Servers
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Frontend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Backend
npm run dev:server
```

### 2. Set Up Webhook Forwarding (for local testing)
```bash
# Terminal 3 - Keep this running!
./scripts/setup-stripe-webhook.sh
```

### 3. Test the Flow
1. Sign in to the app
2. Click "Buy Credits" or wait for the upgrade prompt
3. Select a package and click "Purchase"
4. Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
5. Complete checkout
6. Credits are automatically added!

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Frontend loads without errors
- [ ] Backend server is running on port 3001
- [ ] Webhook forwarding is active (Stripe CLI)
- [ ] Can create checkout session
- [ ] Redirects to Stripe checkout
- [ ] Test payment completes
- [ ] Webhook is received and processed
- [ ] Credits are added to account
- [ ] Success page displays
- [ ] Can use new credits immediately

## Production Deployment Notes

Before deploying to production:

1. **Update Stripe Keys**: Use production keys instead of test keys
2. **Configure Webhook**: Add production webhook URL in Stripe dashboard
3. **Update URLs**: Change localhost URLs to production domain
4. **Enable HTTPS**: Required for Stripe webhooks
5. **Set Environment Variables**: Ensure all keys are set in production

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Invalid webhook signature"**
   - Update `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` with value from Stripe CLI
   - Restart dev server

2. **Credits not added**
   - Check webhook forwarding is running
   - Verify `add_paid_credits` function exists in Supabase
   - Check server logs for errors

3. **Checkout fails**
   - Verify Stripe keys are correct
   - Ensure user is authenticated
   - Check price IDs match your account

### Verification Script
Run this to verify your Stripe products:
```bash
node scripts/verify-stripe-products.js
```

## Security Notes

- Secret keys are server-side only
- Webhook signatures are verified
- User permissions are validated
- All transactions are logged
- Idempotency prevents duplicate credits

The integration is now complete and ready for testing!
