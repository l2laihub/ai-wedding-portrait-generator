## How to Use

### Accessing Prompt Management
1. Navigate to the Admin Dashboard
2. Click on "Prompts" in the sidebar navigation
3. Select a prompt template to view/edit

### Editing Prompts
1. Select a prompt template from the list
2. Click the "Edit" button
3. Modify the template text using the textarea
4. Use available variables: `{style}`, `{customPrompt}`, `{familyMemberCount}`
5. Click "Save Changes" to apply

### Testing Prompts
1. Select a prompt template
2. Click the "Test" button
3. Choose a wedding style from the dropdown
4. Add a custom prompt (optional)
5. Set family member count (for family portraits)
6. View the generated prompt and copy if needed

### Export/Import
- **Export**: Click "Export" button to download all prompts as JSON
- **Import**: Click "Import" button and select a JSON file to upload

## Technical Details

### Storage
- Prompts are stored in localStorage under the key `wedai_admin_prompts`
- Automatic fallback to default prompts if storage fails
- Version tracking for change management

### Integration
- The `promptService` handles all prompt operations
- `secureGeminiService` uses the prompt service for generation
- Automatic fallback to hardcoded prompts if service fails

### Default Prompts

#### Single Person
```
Transform the SINGLE PERSON in this image into a FULL BODY wedding portrait with a "{style}" theme. This is a SINGLE PERSON portrait - NOT a couple. Create a professional bridal/groom portrait showing them ALONE. Keep their face EXACTLY identical to the original - preserve ALL facial features, expressions, and complete likeness. Show the complete wedding outfit from head to toe, including dress/suit details, shoes, and accessories. {customPrompt}. Ensure their face remains perfectly consistent and unchanged from the original photo while creating a stunning full-length INDIVIDUAL portrait.
```

#### Couple
```
Transform the TWO PEOPLE (couple) in this image into a beautiful wedding portrait with a "{style}" theme. This is a COUPLE portrait - there should be TWO people in the result. Keep BOTH their faces EXACTLY identical to the original - preserve their facial features, expressions, and likeness completely. Maintain BOTH subjects' identity while transforming only their clothing and background to match the wedding style. {customPrompt}. Make them look like they are dressed for a wedding in that style, but ensure BOTH faces remain perfectly consistent and unchanged from the original photo.
```

#### Family
```
Transform this family of {familyMemberCount} people into a beautiful wedding portrait with a "{style}" theme. Crucially, preserve the exact likeness of EACH and EVERY family member's face and unique facial features. Only transform their clothing and the environment. Ensure all {familyMemberCount} individuals from the original photo are present and their identity is clearly recognizable. {customPrompt}.
```

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Prompts
1. **Be Specific**: Clearly specify the number of people expected
2. **Preserve Identity**: Emphasize maintaining facial features and likeness
3. **Include Variables**: Use `{style}` and `{customPrompt}` for flexibility
4. **Full Body Context**: Specify when full-body portraits are desired
5. **Style Integration**: Explain how the wedding style should be applied

### Testing and Validation
1. **Test with Multiple Styles**: Ensure prompts work across different wedding themes
2. **Verify Variables**: Check that all variables are properly substituted
3. **Edge Cases**: Test with extreme family sizes (2, 10+ members)
4. **Custom Prompts**: Test with various custom prompt inputs

### Backup and Versioning
1. **Regular Exports**: Download prompt configurations regularly
2. **Version Tracking**: Monitor version numbers for change tracking
3. **Testing Before Deployment**: Test modified prompts before saving
4. **Document Changes**: Keep notes on why prompts were modified

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Variables Not Substituting**: Check variable names match exactly `{style}`, `{customPrompt}`, `{familyMemberCount}`
- **Import Failures**: Ensure JSON format is valid and contains required fields
- **Storage Issues**: Clear localStorage if prompts appear corrupted
- **Fallback Behavior**: System automatically uses hardcoded prompts if service fails

### Error Messages
- `"Invalid format: expected array of prompts"` - JSON file is not an array
- `"Invalid prompt format: missing required fields"` - Prompt objects missing id, type, or template
- `"Invalid prompt type"` - Type must be 'single', 'couple', or 'family'
