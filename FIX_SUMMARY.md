# Buy Credits & Profile Enhancements - Fix Summary

## 🎯 Issues Resolved

### 1. **Credit Calculation Problem** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: All purchases were adding 25 credits regardless of package (10, 25, or 75 credits)

**Root Cause**: 
- SuccessPage was calling `verify_payment_and_add_credits()` function which hardcoded 25 credits
- This created duplicate processing (webhook + client-side) with incorrect client-side logic

**Solution**:
- Removed hardcoded credit calculation from SuccessPage
- Now relies entirely on webhook processing which correctly calculates:
  - $4.99 = 10 credits (Starter Pack)
  - $9.99 = 25 credits (Wedding Pack) 
  - $24.99 = 75 credits (Party Pack)

### 2. **Profile Credit Balance Display** ✅ ENHANCED
**Problem**: Profile only showed basic daily usage, not comprehensive credit balance

**Solution**: Enhanced UserProfile component with:
- **Total available credits** prominently displayed
- **Credit type breakdown**: Free daily, Purchased, Bonus credits
- **Daily usage progress** bar for free credits
- **Smart status messages** based on credit levels
- **Refresh button** for manual balance updates
- **Real-time loading** states

## 📁 Files Modified

### Core Fixes:
1. **`components/SuccessPage.tsx`**
   - Removed `verify_payment_and_add_credits` call

   - Improved success messages

5. **`scripts/test-credit-calculation.js`** - Credit calculation verification

## 🧪 Test Results

### Credit Calculation Test ✅
```
✅ Starter Pack: 499 cents → 10 credits

✅ Party Pack: 2499 cents → 75 credits
```

### Payment Flow Test ✅

```

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### Purchase Flow:
1. User selects credit package and completes Stripe checkout
2. **Stripe webhook** receives `checkout.session.completed` event
3. **Webhook handler** calculates correct credits based on `amount_total`
4. **Database function** `add_paid_credits()` atomically adds credits
5. **SuccessPage** shows confirmation (no longer processes credits)
6. **Profile** displays updated balance with comprehensive breakdown

### Profile Credit Display:
- **Total Available**: Main credit count prominently shown
- **Breakdown**: Free daily, Purchased, Bonus credits separately
- **Usage Progress**: Visual progress bar for daily free credits
- **Status Messages**: Smart indicators based on credit levels
- **Refresh Button**: Manual balance updates
- **Real-time Updates**: Loads on modal open

## 💡 Key Improvements

1. **Accurate Credit Calculation**: All pricing tiers now work correctly
2. **Single Source of Truth**: Only webhook processes payments (no duplicate logic)
3. **Enhanced User Experience**: Comprehensive credit visibility in profile
4. **Real-time Updates**: Credit balance refreshes automatically
5. **Better Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and loading states
6. **Comprehensive Testing**: Automated verification of all pricing tiers

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Webhook Credit Logic:
```typescript
switch (amountTotal) {
  case 499:  creditsToAdd = 10;  break;  // $4.99 Starter
  case 999:  creditsToAdd = 25;  break;  // $9.99 Wedding  
  case 2499: creditsToAdd = 75;  break;  // $24.99 Party
}
```

### Profile Integration:
```typescript
const creditBalance = await creditsService.getBalance();
// Displays: totalAvailable, freeRemaining, paidCredits, bonusCredits
```
