// Single Portrait Builder
function buildSinglePrompt(
  style: string, 
  customPrompt?: string, 
  useEnhanced: boolean = true
): string {
  const enhanceSection = customPrompt?.trim() 
    ? `\n\nENHANCE: ${customPrompt}` 
    : '';
  
  const template = useEnhanced 
    ? SINGLE_PORTRAIT_ENHANCED 
    : SINGLE_PORTRAIT_BASIC;
  
  return template
    .replace(/{style}/g, style)
    .replace(/{enhanceSection}/g, enhanceSection);
}

- **Detailed venue descriptions** injected into {style}
- **Atmospheric lighting** from theme modifiers
- **Mood-appropriate instructions** prepended/appended
- **Style-specific details** for better AI guidance

const prompt = buildCouplePrompt(
  'Classic & Timeless Wedding'
);
// Output has NO ENHANCE section - clean and professional
```

### **Example with Empty String**
```typescript
const prompt = buildFamilyPrompt(
  5,
  'Rustic Barn Wedding',
  ''  // Empty string
);
// Output has NO ENHANCE section - handles empty strings gracefully
