  if (peopleCount >= 3) return 'family-portrait';

  style: string, 
  customPrompt?: string, 
  useEnhanced: boolean = true
): string {
  const enhanceSection = customPrompt?.trim() 
    ? `\n\nENHANCE: ${customPrompt}` 
    : '';
  
  const template = useEnhanced 
    ? SINGLE_PORTRAIT_ENHANCED

const prompt = buildCouplePrompt(
  'Classic & Timeless Wedding'
);
// Output has NO ENHANCE section - clean and professional
```

### **Example with Empty String**
```typescript
const prompt = buildFamilyPrompt(
  5,
  'Rustic Barn Wedding',
  ''  // Empty string
