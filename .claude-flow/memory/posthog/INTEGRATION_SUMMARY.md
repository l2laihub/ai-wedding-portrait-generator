# PostHog Analytics Integration Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the PostHog analytics integration plan for the AI Wedding Portrait Generator. It serves as a coordination point for all agents working on this implementation.

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Planning Complete
- **Next Action**: Review plan and begin Phase 1 implementation
- **Estimated Total Effort**: 14-22 hours across 6 phases

## Key Integration Points

### 1. User Journey Tracking
- **Page Load** → **Image Upload** → **Generation** → **Results** → **Download/Share**
- Each step will have detailed event tracking with performance metrics

### 2. Critical Events to Track
- `image_upload_started/completed/failed`
- `generation_started/completed/failed`
- `portrait_downloaded` (with style info)
- `portrait_shared` (with method)
- `custom_prompt_used`
- `pwa_installed`

### 3. Performance Metrics
- Page load time
- Image upload duration
- AI generation time (per style and total)
- Network impact on performance
- API response times

### 4. User Properties
- Device type (mobile/desktop)
- Theme preference
- Network quality
- Generation count
- PWA installation status

### 5. Lead Capture Strategy
- Trigger after 2nd generation (high intent)
- Optional before download
- During PWA install flow
- Non-intrusive modal with value proposition

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (2-3 hours)
- Install PostHog SDK
- Create analytics service and hook
- Add privacy consent
- Basic initialization

### Phase 2: Core Events (3-4 hours)
- Image upload tracking
- Generation flow tracking
- Results interaction tracking
- Error tracking

### Phase 3: Performance (2-3 hours)
- API call metrics
- Page performance
- Network impact analysis

### Phase 4: User Properties (2 hours)
- User identification
- Feature flags
- Cohort creation

### Phase 5: Lead Capture (3-4 hours)
- Modal component
- Email validation
- CRM integration

### Phase 6: Advanced Analytics (2-3 hours)
- Custom dashboards
- A/B testing setup
- Alerts configuration

## Technical Considerations

### Privacy & Compliance
- No personal image data tracked
- Analytics consent banner required
- Opt-out mechanism
- GDPR/CCPA compliance

### Performance Impact
- Async script loading
- Event batching (10 events, 5s interval)
- No impact on core functionality
- Mobile-optimized configuration

### Integration Architecture
- Centralized analytics hook (`useAnalytics`)
- Context-aware event tracking
- Type-safe event properties
- Error boundary protection

## Coordination Points

### For Frontend Agents
- Use `useAnalytics` hook for all tracking
- Include relevant context in events
- Follow naming convention: `noun_verb` (e.g., `image_uploaded`)

### For Backend Agents
- PostHog webhooks available for server-side processing
- Lead data can be sent to CRM via webhooks
- Server-side event tracking possible if needed

### For DevOps Agents
- Add PostHog environment variables to deployment
- Ensure CSP allows PostHog domains
- Monitor PostHog API quota usage

## Success Metrics

### Technical Success
- <50ms impact on page load
- 95%+ event delivery rate
- No user-facing errors

### Business Success
- Complete funnel visibility
- Lead capture rate >5%
- Actionable performance insights
- Data-driven feature decisions

## Memory Hook Keys

Agents should use these keys for coordination:
- `posthog/requirements` - Current requirements analysis
- `posthog/integration-plan` - Detailed implementation plan
- `posthog/progress` - Current implementation status
- `posthog/phase-1-implementation` - Phase 1 implementation guide

## Questions or Blockers?

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the progress.json for known blockers
2. Update progress.json with new findings
3. Coordinate via memory hooks
4. Escalate critical issues
