## PostHog Integration Plan for AI Wedding Portrait Generator

### Overview
This document outlines the complete PostHog analytics integration plan implemented for tracking user behavior, performance metrics, and lead generation in the React application.

### Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETED

### Architecture

#### Core Service Layer
- **PostHogService** (`services/posthogService.ts`)
  - Singleton pattern for consistent state management
  - Type-safe event tracking with TypeScript interfaces
  - Automatic timing measurements for generation metrics
  - Feature flag management with caching
  - User identification and property management

#### Hooks Integration
- **useFeatureFlags** (`hooks/useFeatureFlags.ts`)
  - Real-time feature flag management
  - Automatic refresh every 30 seconds
  - Application-specific flag definitions
  - Loading states for UI optimization

### Event Tracking Strategy

#### 1. User Journey Tracking
- **App Load**: User identification, device properties, referrer tracking
- **Image Upload**: File validation, upload method, performance timing
- **Generation**: Style selection, prompt customization, success/failure rates
- **Engagement**: Style viewing, image downloads, feature usage

#### 2. Performance Monitoring
- **Upload Performance**: File size impact, upload duration, failure rates
- **Generation Performance**: Individual style timing, concurrent vs sequential
- **User Experience**: Time-to-first-interaction, session duration

#### 3. Lead Generation Tracking
- **User Identification**: Persistent user IDs, device fingerprinting
- **Engagement Scoring**: Upload → Generate → Download funnel
- **Feature Adoption**: Feature flag usage, advanced features

### Feature Flags Implementation

#### Available Flags
- `enable_sequential_generation`: Force sequential style generation
- `show_generation_progress`: Enhanced progress indicators
- `enable_advanced_prompts`: Advanced prompt customization UI
- `show_style_picker`: Manual style selection interface
- `enable_download_analytics`: Enhanced download tracking
- `show_beta_features`: Beta feature visibility
- `enable_premium_styles`: Premium style access
- `show_social_sharing`: Social sharing buttons

#### Usage Example
```typescript
const { flags } = useAppFeatureFlags();
const useSequential = flags[FEATURE_FLAGS.ENABLE_SEQUENTIAL_GENERATION];
```

### Environment Configuration

#### Required Variables
```env
POSTHOG_API_KEY=your_posthog_api_key_here
POSTHOG_API_HOST=https://app.posthog.com  # Optional
```

#### Vite Configuration
- Environment variables exposed via `vite.config.ts`
- Process environment mapping for compatibility
- Development vs production configurations

### Analytics Dashboard Setup

#### Key Metrics to Monitor
1. **Conversion Funnel**
   - App loads → Image uploads
   - Uploads → Generations
   - Generations → Downloads

2. **Performance KPIs**
   - Average upload time
   - Generation success rate
   - Style completion rates
   - Download conversion rate

3. **User Behavior**
   - Most popular styles
   - Prompt modification patterns
   - Feature flag adoption
   - Session duration

4. **Technical Metrics**
   - Error rates by component
   - Device/browser distribution
   - Network impact analysis

### Testing Strategy

#### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] PostHog initialization in browser console
- [ ] Event firing in PostHog dashboard
- [ ] User identification persistence
- [ ] Feature flag responsiveness
- [ ] Timing metric accuracy
- [ ] Error event capture

#### Automated Testing
- Unit tests for PostHogService methods
- Integration tests for event firing
- Performance benchmark tests
- Feature flag toggle tests

### Privacy & Compliance

#### Data Collection
- Anonymous user identification
- Device/browser metadata
- Performance metrics only
- No PII or image content stored

#### User Control
- Opt-out capability via PostHog
- Local storage management
- Feature flag override options

### Monitoring & Maintenance

#### Regular Tasks
- Monitor event volume and costs
- Review feature flag performance
- Analyze user journey dropoffs
- Update event schemas as needed

#### Alert Thresholds
- High error rates (>5%)
- Low upload success rates (<90%)
- Feature flag access failures
- Performance degradation

### Future Enhancements

#### Potential Additions
- A/B testing for UI components
- Cohort analysis for user segments
- Real-time dashboard for admins
- Advanced funnel analysis
- Custom event taxonomies

#### Integration Opportunities
- Email marketing platform sync
- Customer support integration
- Revenue tracking (if monetized)
- Social media analytics

### Support & Documentation

#### For Developers
- TypeScript interfaces for all events
- Comprehensive JSDoc comments
- Error handling examples
- Testing utilities

#### For Product Team
- Event naming conventions
- Property schema documentation
- Dashboard setup guides
- KPI tracking templates

### Conclusion
The PostHog integration provides comprehensive analytics coverage for the AI Wedding Portrait Generator, enabling data-driven product decisions and user experience optimization while maintaining privacy compliance.
