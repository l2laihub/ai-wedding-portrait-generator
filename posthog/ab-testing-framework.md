## Test Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Feature Flag Configuration

#### Basic Feature Flag Structure
```javascript
// PostHog Feature Flag Setup
const testVariant = posthog.getFeatureFlag('upload_cta_test');

// In React component
const getUploadCTA = () => {
  switch(testVariant) {
    case 'variant_a':
      return "Start Creating Your Wedding Portrait";
    case 'variant_b': 
      return "Transform Your Photo Into Art";
    case 'variant_c':
      return "Upload Your Couple Photo Now";
    default:
      return "Click to upload or drag and drop";
  }
};
```

#### Advanced Personalization Flags
```javascript
// Dynamic feature flags with user properties
const getPersonalizedVariant = () => {
  const userProps = {
    device_type: posthog.get_property('$device_type'),
    is_returning: posthog.get_property('has_multiple_sessions'),
    lead_score: posthog.get_property('lead_score') || 0
  };
  
  // Server-side logic for complex personalization
  return posthog.getFeatureFlag('personalized_experience', {
    person_properties: userProps
  });
};
```

### 2. Multivariate Testing Setup

#### Complex Test Configuration
```yaml
Test Name: "Complete UX Optimization"
Type: Multivariate (2x2x2 = 8 variants)

Factors:
  upload_cta: [original, action_oriented]
  generation_button: [standard, urgent]
  result_display: [all_at_once, progressive]

Traffic Allocation: 12.5% each
Minimum Detectable Effect: 10%
Statistical Power: 80%
Significance Level: 95%
```

### 3. Test Measurement Framework

#### Event Tracking for Tests
```javascript
// Track test participation
posthog.capture('test_variant_assigned', {
  test_name: 'upload_cta_test',
  variant: testVariant,
  user_segment: getUserSegment(),
  test_start_date: testStartDate
});

// Track test-specific events
posthog.capture('upload_cta_clicked', {
  test_name: 'upload_cta_test',
  variant: testVariant,
  cta_text: getUploadCTA(),
  time_to_click_ms: timeToClick
});
```

#### Statistical Analysis Queries
```sql
-- Conversion Rate by Variant
SELECT 
  properties->test_variant as variant,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as users,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN converted THEN user_id END) as conversions,
  (COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN converted THEN user_id END) * 100.0 / 
   COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)) as conversion_rate
FROM events 
WHERE 
  properties->test_name = 'upload_cta_test'
  AND timestamp >= test_start_date
GROUP BY properties->test_variant;

-- Statistical Significance Calculator
WITH variant_stats AS (
  SELECT 
    variant,
    users,
    conversions,
    conversion_rate,
    -- Calculate standard error
    SQRT((conversion_rate/100 * (1-conversion_rate/100)) / users) as standard_error
  FROM conversion_results
)
SELECT 
  *,
  -- Z-score calculation for significance testing
  ABS(a.conversion_rate - b.conversion_rate) / 
  SQRT(a.standard_error^2 + b.standard_error^2) as z_score,
  -- P-value approximation
  CASE 
    WHEN z_score > 1.96 THEN 'Significant at 95%'
    WHEN z_score > 1.645 THEN 'Significant at 90%'
    ELSE 'Not Significant'
  END as significance
FROM variant_stats a, variant_stats b
WHERE a.variant = 'control' AND b.variant = 'test';
```

## Advanced Testing Strategies

### 1. Sequential Testing Framework

#### Bayesian A/B Testing
```javascript
// Implement Bayesian updating for faster decisions
const calculateBayesianProbability = (controlData, testData) => {
  // Prior beliefs: uniform distribution
  const priorAlpha = 1;
  const priorBeta = 1;
  
  // Update with observed data
  const controlPosterior = {
    alpha: priorAlpha + controlData.conversions,
    beta: priorBeta + controlData.failures
  };
  
  const testPosterior = {
    alpha: priorAlpha + testData.conversions,
    beta: priorBeta + testData.failures
  };
  
  // Calculate probability that test > control
  return calculateBetaProbability(testPosterior, controlPosterior);
};
```

### 2. Multi-Armed Bandit Tests

#### Dynamic Traffic Allocation
```yaml
Strategy: "Smart Traffic Distribution"
Description: "Automatically shift traffic to winning variants"

Algorithm:
  - Start with equal traffic split
  - Update allocation based on performance every 1000 users
  - Maintain minimum 10% traffic to losing variants
  - Stop test when confidence > 95%

Implementation:
  - Use Thompson Sampling for exploration
  - Update PostHog feature flag percentages via API
  - Monitor for statistical significance
```

### 3. Cohort-Based Testing

#### Time-Based Cohorts
```javascript
// Test impact on user cohorts
const getCohortTestVariant = (userId) => {
  const userFirstSeen = posthog.get_property('first_seen_at');
  const dayOfWeek = new Date(userFirstSeen).getDay();
  
  // Assign based on day they first visited
  return dayOfWeek % 2 === 0 ? 'control' : 'test';
};
```

### 4. Cross-Platform Testing

#### Device-Specific Tests
```yaml
Mobile-Only Tests:
  - Touch-optimized interactions
  - Vertical layout variations  
  - PWA install prompts
  - Share functionality

Desktop-Only Tests:
  - Drag-and-drop enhancements
  - Keyboard shortcuts
  - Multi-window support
  - High-resolution previews
```
