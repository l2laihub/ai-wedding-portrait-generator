# Waitlist Bonus Credits Implementation Guide

## 📊 Current Status
- **Promise**: 10 bonus portrait credits for waitlist users when paid plans launch
- **Waitlist Modal**: Already collecting emails with promised_credits = 10
- **Paid System**: Still in testing, not yet launched

## 🎯 Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Track Conversions (Implement Now)
✅ **Database Migration Created**: `20250916_enhance_waitlist_tracking.sql`
- Tracks when waitlist emails sign up as users
- Links waitlist entries to user accounts
- Prepares for automatic bonus distribution

### Phase 2: Before Paid System Launch

#### 1. **Add Bonus Credits Function** (Already exists in your migrations!)
```sql
-- You already have this in your credits system:
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION add_bonus_credits(
  p_user_id UUID,
  p_credits INTEGER,
  p_description TEXT
) RETURNS VOID
```

#### 2. **Update Success Message After Signup**
When a user signs up with a waitlist email, show:
```typescript
// In your signup success handler
if (isWaitlistUser) {
  showNotification(
    "Welcome back! Your 10 bonus credits will be automatically added when our paid plans launch. 
    You'll receive an email notification!"
  );
}
```

#### 3. **Email Notification System**
Create email templates for:
- Immediate: "Thanks for joining the waitlist! 10 bonus credits awaiting..."
- On conversion: "Welcome! Your bonus credits are pending..."
- On launch: "🎉 Your 10 bonus credits are now active!"

### Phase 3: Launch Day Execution

#### 1. **Run Bonus Distribution**
```sql
-- Execute this query when launching paid system:
SELECT * FROM grant_pending_waitlist_bonuses();
```

#### 2. **Send Launch Emails**
```typescript
// Email all waitlist users
async function notifyWaitlistLaunch() {
  const waitlistUsers = await getWaitlistUsers();
  
  for (const user of waitlistUsers) {
    const status = user.converted_user_id 
      ? "Your 10 bonus credits are now active!" 
      : "Sign up now to claim your 10 bonus credits!";
    
    await sendEmail({
      to: user.email,
      subject: "🎉 WedAI Paid Plans Are Live!",
      template: "waitlist-launch",
      data: { status, bonusCredits: 10 }
    });
  }
}
```

### Phase 4: Post-Launch Features

#### 1. **Admin Dashboard Component**
```typescript
// components/admin/WaitlistDashboard.tsx
const WaitlistDashboard = () => {
  const [stats, setStats] = useState({
    totalWaitlist: 0,
    totalConverted: 0,
    conversionRate: 0,
    pendingBonuses: 0,
    totalPromisedCredits: 0
  });

  // Show conversion funnel
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Waitlist Analytics</h2>
      <div className="stats-grid">
        <Stat label="Total Signups" value={stats.totalWaitlist} />
        <Stat label="Converted Users" value={stats.totalConverted} />
        <Stat label="Conversion Rate" value={`${stats.conversionRate}%`} />
        <Stat label="Pending Bonuses" value={stats.pendingBonuses} />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### 2. **User Profile Enhancement**
Show bonus status in UserProfile:
```typescript
{creditBalance.bonusCredits > 0 && (
  <div className="bonus-credits-badge">
    <Icon path={giftIcon} />
    <span>{creditBalance.bonusCredits} bonus credits from early access!</span>
  </div>
)}
```

## 🚀 Launch Checklist

### Pre-Launch
- [ ] Deploy waitlist tracking migration
- [ ] Test signup flow with waitlist emails
- [ ] Prepare email templates
- [ ] Create admin dashboard
- [ ] Test bonus distribution function

### Launch Day
- [ ] Run `grant_pending_waitlist_bonuses()` function

- [ ] Handle support inquiries

### Post-Launch
- [ ] Track conversion rates
- [ ] A/B test different bonus amounts for future campaigns

## 💡 Best Practices

1. **Transparency**: Always show users their pending bonus status
2. **Automation**: Use triggers to handle conversions automatically
3. **Tracking**: Monitor conversion rates to measure campaign success
4. **Communication**: Send regular updates to keep waitlist engaged

## 🎁 Bonus Ideas for Future

1. **Tiered Bonuses**:
   - First 100 users: 20 credits
   - Next 500: 15 credits
   - Everyone else: 10 credits

2. **Referral Multiplier**:
   - Base: 10 credits
   - +5 credits per friend referred who signs up

3. **Early Bird Special**:
   - Sign up within 48 hours of launch: Double bonus (20 credits)

## 📊 Success Metrics

Track these KPIs:
- Waitlist → Signup conversion rate (target: 30-40%)
- Time to conversion (average days from waitlist to signup)
- Bonus credit usage rate (how quickly they use the 10 credits)
- Paid conversion after bonus usage (target: 20-30%)
